<article>

  <p>And then, the other day, I realized that in a warm and rainy autumn of seven years ago, on St Francis’s day, in a chapel in Assisi behind the <a href="/glossary">Porziuncola Church</a>, we —really the two of us— exchanged a ring and, with a twenty-year-old voice (I was almost 20, Francesco was 27), we promised eternal faithfulness to each other.</p>

<p>So here we are: we are going through our seventh year!!!</p>

<p>The first question was: “So isn’t our marriage supposed to be on the rocks ?”. The second: “How could it happen that SEVEN years have passed and I still don’t have a KitchenAid robot ?”. The third question, however, was more reassuring: “We Raos always rush ahead with everything, probably we got the seven-year itch  in the third year already”. In fact, now that I think of it, on the third year of marriage we were in France since already two years, and our marriage was  definitely in trouble. A very difficult year: with one job about to end  and another one that <strong>wasn’t</strong> starting, two little girls and so many difficulties. In that third year it seemed that all the other’s flaws came out effortlessly and carelessly, sharp and unbearable. A difficult year indeed.</p>

<p>There’s one thing I remember most of all: I had two paths in front of me, I could give up because “I deserve something better”, or I could give a chance to our marriage and to God, trusting that that famous October 3rd He ensured His presence in our house. I decided to change clothes and equipment to undertake the more adventurous and less clear path and to discover new worlds. We had a furious fight, in which I said that if I had known all his faults  maybe I would have thought twice about marrying him. But he said that the Lord hid them from  me on purpose, because otherwise I would have missed my vocation, which is the most beautiful thing in my life. At this point of the story my most dear Sicilian friend would say - <strong>Miii, raggione c’aveva</strong>! (Indeed he was right!)</p>

<p>And he was right indeed, because —having dropped the weapons— I realized that those bad flaws were coincidentally touching the very deepest wounds of my life, and that maybe —and I say maaaaybe— they were  an opportunity to face them. And well, it was really just like that.</p>

<p>So, did our marriage already hit the famous seven-year itch, or the troubles of the third year don’t count? Do we have to renew it? Is it a requirement for a marriage to hit the rocks right on the seventh year?</p>

<p>Perhaps on the seventh year we should renew our marriage vows before going into troubles. But then this marital crisis… who invited it? Who opened the door to it? And, above all, who wants it? Who does it think it is to dictate law in our house? Maybe it came in while we were too busy paying the increasing electricity bills or organizing the dance classes for the kids, which —go figure why— are always at two different and both uncomfortable times. Or did it visit our place while we were busy on the phone arranging shifts to stay, at least one of us, with the kids.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Him: But darling! Don’t you remember?! The two of us together invited it during those boring evenings spent watching TV, when step by step we were no longer planning any dates, we had no projects in which to engage ourselves, each of us began to see his/her own goals, and there was no longer the two of us on our minds, but a whole list of things to do.</li>
  <li>Me: Are you sure? I am usually the one who invites people here, and now that I think of it I wrote Crisis our address by mail, one of  those days when getting through the day with a shower and no vomiting on the shirt was already a success. And I always forgot to smile at you when you were coming back home tired from work.</li>
  <li>Him: What I remember is that Madame Crisis knocked on the door so many times and I never paid attention, but one day I was tired and I didn’t want to discuss or clarify, so I listened to it right there in front of the door, but I assure you that I didn’t let it in!</li>
  <li>Me: So let’s send it away! I will write down everything I must forget no more, and I will thank it because it left us something good.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have the impression that often we get married with the best intentions, great projects, sometimes facing many difficulties, but then we get lost in trivial daily things to do and we forget how beautiful it is to have a project together, to fully engage in something, to have the time to be alone and rediscover each other, to renew the marriage vows, to <strong>re-marry</strong>. I think that for us this year is not the seven-year itch one. I have the impression that there is a movement within us and we don’t know where it will lead us, but just talking about it brings us joy and unites us.</p>
