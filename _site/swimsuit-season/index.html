<article>

  <p>Last Saturday in Freiburg, because of the bad weather, we decided to play the “classic Italian family”, that means to spend the day in a shopping mall. After crossing the German border, we entered the Decathlon in Colmar, France (the Rao family considers this the best mall of all). There were many things we had to find: the right camping tent for the whole crew —little cousin included—, sleeping bags for Chiara and Maria, a new helmet for daddy, swimsuits for my sweeties, and finally a swimsuit for mom (!!!).</p>

<p>Once in the fitting room, I tried on a cute bikini while one of my kids kept walking in and out as if mom wasn’t naked, and daddy peeked. As soon as I tried it on, I immediately noticed an anomaly in the mirror; it looked like one of those mirrors that distort your image. I don’t buy it: the mirror is telling me I have a third month of pregnancy belly, but all flabby and full of stretch marks (!!). I get out of the fitting room quite annoyed, saying I can’t absolutely buy a swimsuit in a store with distorting mirrors. Recalling the chats I had earlier with my friends about how men, once they reach forty years old, usually either buy a BMW or go out with a twenty-year-old, and considering that Francesco was not far from forty, I decided to instantly start a diet!</p>

<p>There’s nothing we can do about it; stretch marks —in my case three times traced— are not trendy. I’m not sure if they used to be trendy when my mother or my grandmother were young, maybe they didn’t even have time to go to the beach at all. What I know is that I don’t like them that much, but at the same time, I’m proud of having them; proud of carrying the signs of life on my body as Jesus carries, even after the resurrection, the signs of the nails. I know, it’s a bold comparison, but it’s always a matter of giving life. I’m not saying it as an excuse, I swear I am on diet and in the morning I even do those workout exercises that in our family are known as <em>lardominals</em>! I just want to say that us mothers should be proud of our ugly stretch marks. They should be our banner — Here I am, I’m a mom! I may not have done much good in life, but at least I have given my life for someone, I gave birth to a human cub.</p>

<p>It would be much nicer if we looked at our body in this way. Our life, and then also our body, is useless if it’s not spent for someone. You could even have one of the most beautiful bodies, you could be the hottest woman in the country, but what’s to do with it if not spending yourself for something greater, something that is worth? something great… incredibly great.</p>

<p>These few lines wanted to be a hymn to us, flabby-belly moms. And husbands, have mercy on us even if you are reaching forty, and be proud and boast about your wife’s stretch marks.</p>
