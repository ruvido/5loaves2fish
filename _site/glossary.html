  <p><strong>10 Commandments</strong>:
Two years class about the 10 Commandments, held all over Italy. During this class the 10 commandments are presented not as the common-known moral rules, but rather as love teachings that speak to the deep, personal and daily aspects of our life.</p>

<p><strong>Assisi Classes</strong>:
Classes, retreats and spiritual direction for young people offered by a group of Franciscan Friars.</p>

<p><strong>Costanza Miriano</strong>:
Italian journalist, catholic writer and blogger (<a href="http://costanzamiriano.com">costanzamiriano.com</a>). Her most popular book is “Marry Him and Be Submissive”, recently translated into English.</p>

<p><strong>Franciscan March</strong>:
One week pilgrimage in the area of Assisi, organized every year by Franciscan Friars.</p>

<p><strong>Ingannevole come l’Amore (Deceptive as Love) - by Mimmo and Cinzia</strong>:
A three days-course offered by a Mimmo and Cinzia, couple who helps young people and couples to grow and answer to their vocation to Love. The course is held every 6 months in San Giovanni Rotondo, Puglia (Italy).</p>

<p><strong>Love calls, love is urgent!</strong>:
What is love? <em>Love calls</em> is a three day workshop organized by 5loaves2fish. This experience aims to help you find your path with the Lord in your daily life: in your job, in love, in your dating experience, in your hard times, and much more! In addition, we like to enjoy our three days together celebrating, praying and listening to stories of people who are walking in their way to the Lord.
The location changes every time. Next ones are: Italy, Germany and (God willing) the United States. More info <a href="/events">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Porziuncola Church</strong>:
Small church in Assisi, located within the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels. The Porziuncola Church was very dear to St Francis, who also died there.</p>
