<article>

  <p>You have listened to a beautiful announcement in <a href="/glossary">Assisi</a>. You have been struck and moved by the depth of those words that went straight into the heart. You have seen a truth in them, a truth about your life. You have realized there’s no use in living for those few things you used to fight for, which gave you nothing but burdens in exchange for false certainties. Maybe you were distant and thanks to the announcement in Assisi you have converted and you’ve approached the Church, that mother that everyone judges. You have encountered the Lord. <em>You have believed in a great beauty</em>, in a promise of happiness no one ever made to you.</p>

<p>But the day comes when things <strong>don’t go the way you expected</strong>.</p>

<p>One disappointment after the other, you wonder where the hell is the fulfillment of those promises. A choked cry inside your heart. Everything collapses. Faith collapses, hope collapses; there is no truth. I have been cheated.</p>

<p>Francesco and I are part of a long stream of people who went to <a href="/glossary">Assisi</a>. There we heard strong announcements, which disrupted our plans and encouraged us to change our lives, <em>to discover an essential beauty</em>. At that point we couldn’t help but leave everything and immediately seize all those good things we heard of. It was like that for us. After a spiritual journey in Assisi we got married with no certainties. We were 20 years old, we hadn’t finished college, we didn’t have a permanent job nor much consciousness.</p>

<p>Things didn’t really go the way we had imagined. After just one year in Rome we were forced to move to France with our three-month baby. We didn’t know anyone there, we couldn’t speak a word of French and we felt really alone. It was a tough period. After some time I found myself with two little girls, with a workaholic husband who was never home, in a culture where children are considered mere brats, where mothers hang out only when their children are not around, where pre-school is an essential and supreme goal (even for those who don’t work and have nothing to do!), with pending university studies and especially with a relation on the edge of failure…</p>

<p>God where are you? What are you doing to us? Us, who left everything to answer your call to marriage! Lord, we understood that everything was gonna be great, challenging and tiring but beautiful, blessed by You. What’s going on???</p>

<p>There are times when you feel you have been utterly cheated on, and you send to hell friars, nuns, friends who are ahead of you on the path of life and who told you beautiful things. When you find yourself married, standing in front of your husband, and things just haven’t worked out for months, when you don’t understand each other anymore, you become speachless. <em>After this long journey together, what is left?</em> A desolate marriage. But how is it possible Lord?! I have sacrificed my youth to answer to your call! And this is what I get?! I wish I had carried on with my studies, I wish I had traveled with my friends, I wish I had all the experiences a twenty year old has… but I didn’t. Nice swindle Lord! You are just like everyone else! I was blind; I’ve let myself be fooled by the moves of the nuns and the jokes of the friars. What a disappointment, what a failure. Now what? I am alone. After telling my friends, who are far from You, that I was getting married because marriage is a vocation, after telling them that love always comes first, that the Lord can change your life completely, how do I dare asking for help?!</p>

<p>Thank goodness at that time I was far from Assisi and from Rome, and Fr. Giovanni was never answering his phone, otherwise I would have yelled at his face. I was angry, angry with myself, angry with God, and I couldn’t see a way out but admitting the failure of our marriage and the absence of this God the friars talk so much about, the One they call the “Good Father”. Good my a**! What goodness are we talking about! Where is that goodness?</p>

<p>But a word saved me: <strong>What if it was grace?!</strong> A word Fr. Fabio used to say at Mass. Of course just the thought of this made me angry. But then there was a moment when I thought that maybe I wasn’t wrong about God and that this could be <em>my chance to take a leap of faith</em>. With the last tiny bit of faith I had, almost at my break point, I shouted: “<strong>If You really are what I thought You were, what they told me You are, then I believe you are doing everything right. You are hurting me bad and I don’t see the reason for it, but I trust all this has a meaning and You will show it to me</strong>”.</p>

<p>Over the years I have been through several hard times, but never as hard as this one. I’ve seen way worse things happening to couples like ours, couples who walked in the light of the faith, who had wonderful encounters, who had amazing spiritual fathers and who experienced providence at some time in their marriage. I thought that if I followed His teachings things would go well because He is my Father; He would make things right for me. I was truly deluded and I was praying to some god made of butter and honey.</p>

<p>It’s not about performing spiritual somersaults; it’s about believing that the one who is mistaken is you and not God. My friend Chiara helped me come to this realization; the most profound truths happen to be the simplest ones. You can be Christian, Buddhist, believe in the zodiac or in Mary Poppins but <em>if your faith doesn’t save you, you are wasting your time</em>. If you believe in your job or in having fun and those things can’t save you, you’re wasting your time. It’s not about being Christian <strong>so that</strong> Jesus gives you a job in return, so that Jesus gives you love back. If you are Christian, God guides you outside the domain of your certainties and offers Himself to you, which is much greater than the ideal job, than the perfect love, than the optimal satisfaction. If you say yes to Him, you experience it.</p>

<p>This is what faith is about. Faith is not believing that everything is going to be alright and that jasmine flowers will grow in your garden, just because you went to Assisi and you lived two years of chastity with your girlfriend. Faith is not telling nice happy stories when everything goes well, it ain’t that hard, right?! Faith is not the euphoria and the enthusiasm of singing and dancing with friars and nuns. Faith is trust. <em>Faith is believing that He makes everything good</em>, even when you feel you are suffering from injustice. Faith is being in the arms of a Father, who loves you so deeply and thoroughly that He wants you to enter your wounds so that He can help you heal them. Faith is seeing beyond - with your eyes closed – as if blind. Faith is not running away from death; it is living death, smelling its stench and regenerating it through Him with a new perfume. Faith is kneeling and trusting when you <em>do not see a meaning, when you do not understand the reason</em>. Faith is believing that God knows more than you and I. Faith is the humbleness of His servant who does according to His word, even if it goes against the rules for conceiving a child. Faith is realizing that on the other side of the Red Sea there’s a salvation and a joy greater than what you had imagined. Do not stop and cry in front of a sea you deem insurmountable. Don’t give up! Don’t let the Egyptians get to you! Raise that cane and you will see wonders. Climb that mountain to sacrifice what’s dearest to you, the one thing you have been waiting for years and that you finally hold. Go, trust Him! Trust Him with your eyes closed! No one among these men, among our fathers of faith, our brothers, our close friends, has ever been disappointed. None of those who have believed with their eyes closed has been disappointed.</p>

<p>God indeed gives us gifts extraordinarily greater than what we ask. We ask for strength and He gives us climbs, we ask for persistence and He gives us a lengthy path, we ask for faith and He gives us the Red Sea. We are children of a God beyond any measure. What a joy! What a blessing! What a Father!</p>

<p>Come on my friends, com’on! Let us be loved by Him. Beyond our expectations and beliefs of what is good for our lives, there is a goodness that comes from God that we can’t even imagine, a goodness we can only experience with our eyes closed.</p>

<p>Com’on!</p>

<p>Let’s cross the sea!</p>
