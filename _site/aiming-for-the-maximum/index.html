<article>

  <p>Today a dear friend of mine from Spain commented my third awesome pregnant belly reproaching that only the Romanians, “los moros” and Gypsies get to the third child; and then “There are you guys, I just can’t get you”. In fact normal people, those endowed with common sense, realize that today having one child is already a big thing (especially with this crisis), and two are just for the bravest.</p>

<p>It’s not the first time I hear such a talk; or better: I hear nothing but this. The line of thought makes sense: no job, and so no marriage and no children. Live with a minimal life. It’s the crisis’s fault. Francesco and I have been married for almost seven years, we are very young, we’ve got an insecure employment and a super-permanent job - that is 24 hours a day, weekends included - : mom. We know the crisis very well: last month they announced the shutdown of the center where my husband works. In seven years, we have already lived in three different countries, and we are getting kind of tired of not having a fixed abode.</p>

<p>I can think of many children who at the age of 10 have the iPhone, brand jeans, the latest model of shoes, play station, etc. A kid is for sure really expensive nowadays! In order to have another child, maybe I should give up smoking, going to the hairdresser monthly, having my nails done at the beautician, getting second car just to drive for 2 or 3 miles, the Wii, and we’ll have to get tighter at home.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’ve never heard a kid complaining for non-brand jeans, while I see Chiara’s eyes shining when she plays with her sister, and going crazy with joy in front of mom’s belly. I am more and more convinced that offering our kid a relationship, a sibling indeed, is much better than all the fantastic opportunities we think we can offer him with money. Perhaps a child does not ask for things: he asks for you, he asks you to spend yourself for him. He wants your time, he wants you to watch him while he is doing something, he wants to feel worthy of your gaze. He wants and loves your wrinkles and white hair that even at the age of 27 begin to appear. Our children ask us the patience and - when it’s really used up - they love to see mom giving up and letting them watch the second cartoon of the day.</p>

<p>The crisis and its uncertainty are actually teaching me that you have to spend yourself for what is really worth it, without waiting for everything to be perfect. The crisis won’t take away your husband and your kids from you: they are your treasure and the only thing for which it’s worthy spending yourself. Taking control of your life and trusting Someone greater than you - God - isn’t crazy: it’s just another logic, it’s aiming for the maximum.</p>
