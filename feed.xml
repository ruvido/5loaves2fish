&lt;p&gt;So here we are: we are going through our seventh year!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question was: “So isn’t our marriage supposed to be on the rocks ?”. The second: “How could it happen that SEVEN years have passed and I still don’t have a KitchenAid robot ?”. The third question, however, was more reassuring: “We Raos always rush ahead with everything, probably we got the seven-year itch  in the third year already”. In fact, now that I think of it, on the third year of marriage we were in France since already two years, and our marriage was  definitely in trouble. A very difficult year: with one job about to end  and another one that &lt;strong&gt;wasn’t&lt;/strong&gt; starting, two little girls and so many difficulties. In that third year it seemed that all the other’s flaws came out effortlessly and carelessly, sharp and unbearable. A difficult year indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one thing I remember most of all: I had two paths in front of me, I could give up because “I deserve something better”, or I could give a chance to our marriage and to God, trusting that that famous October 3rd He ensured His presence in our house. I decided to change clothes and equipment to undertake the more adventurous and less clear path and to discover new worlds. We had a furious fight, in which I said that if I had known all his faults  maybe I would have thought twice about marrying him. But he said that the Lord hid them from  me on purpose, because otherwise I would have missed my vocation, which is the most beautiful thing in my life. At this point of the story my most dear Sicilian friend would say - &lt;strong&gt;Miii, raggione c’aveva&lt;/strong&gt;! (Indeed he was right!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he was right indeed, because —having dropped the weapons— I realized that those bad flaws were coincidentally touching the very deepest wounds of my life, and that maybe —and I say maaaaybe— they were  an opportunity to face them. And well, it was really just like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, did our marriage already hit the famous seven-year itch, or the troubles of the third year don’t count? Do we have to renew it? Is it a requirement for a marriage to hit the rocks right on the seventh year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps on the seventh year we should renew our marriage vows before going into troubles. But then this marital crisis… who invited it? Who opened the door to it? And, above all, who wants it? Who does it think it is to dictate law in our house? Maybe it came in while we were too busy paying the increasing electricity bills or organizing the dance classes for the kids, which —go figure why— are always at two different and both uncomfortable times. Or did it visit our place while we were busy on the phone arranging shifts to stay, at least one of us, with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Him: But darling! Don’t you remember?! The two of us together invited it during those boring evenings spent watching TV, when step by step we were no longer planning any dates, we had no projects in which to engage ourselves, each of us began to see his/her own goals, and there was no longer the two of us on our minds, but a whole list of things to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me: Are you sure? I am usually the one who invites people here, and now that I think of it I wrote Crisis our address by mail, one of  those days when getting through the day with a shower and no vomiting on the shirt was already a success. And I always forgot to smile at you when you were coming back home tired from work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Him: What I remember is that Madame Crisis knocked on the door so many times and I never paid attention, but one day I was tired and I didn’t want to discuss or clarify, so I listened to it right there in front of the door, but I assure you that I didn’t let it in!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me: So let’s send it away! I will write down everything I must forget no more, and I will thank it because it left us something good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the impression that often we get married with the best intentions, great projects, sometimes facing many difficulties, but then we get lost in trivial daily things to do and we forget how beautiful it is to have a project together, to fully engage in something, to have the time to be alone and rediscover each other, to renew the marriage vows, to &lt;strong&gt;re-marry&lt;/strong&gt;. I think that for us this year is not the seven-year itch one. I have the impression that there is a movement within us and we don’t know where it will lead us, but just talking about it brings us joy and unites us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alessandra</name></author><summary type="html">And then, the other day, I realized that in a warm and rainy autumn of seven years ago, on St Francis’s day, in a chapel in Assisi behind the Porziuncola Church, we —really the two of us— exchanged a ring and, with a twenty-year-old voice (I was almost 20, Francesco was 27), we promised eternal faithfulness to each other.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://5loaves2fish.blog/images/posts/indeed-he-was-right.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Aiming for the maximum</title><link href="http://5loaves2fish.blog/aiming-for-the-maximum/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Aiming for the maximum" /><published>2017-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://5loaves2fish.blog/aiming-for-the-maximum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://5loaves2fish.blog/aiming-for-the-maximum/">&lt;p&gt;Today a dear friend of mine from Spain commented my third awesome pregnant belly reproaching that only the Romanians, “los moros” and Gypsies get to the third child; and then “There are you guys, I just can’t get you”. In fact normal people, those endowed with common sense, realize that today having one child is already a big thing (especially with this crisis), and two are just for the bravest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time I hear such a talk; or better: I hear nothing but this. The line of thought makes sense: no job, and so no marriage and no children. Live with a minimal life. It’s the crisis’s fault. Francesco and I have been married for almost seven years, we are very young, we’ve got an insecure employment and a super-permanent job - that is 24 hours a day, weekends included - : mom. We know the crisis very well: last month they announced the shutdown of the center where my husband works. In seven years, we have already lived in three different countries, and we are getting kind of tired of not having a fixed abode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of many children who at the age of 10 have the iPhone, brand jeans, the latest model of shoes, play station, etc. A kid is for sure really expensive nowadays! In order to have another child, maybe I should give up smoking, going to the hairdresser monthly, having my nails done at the beautician, getting second car just to drive for 2 or 3 miles, the Wii, and we’ll have to get tighter at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I’ve never heard a kid complaining for non-brand jeans, while I see Chiara’s eyes shining when she plays with her sister, and going crazy with joy in front of mom’s belly. I am more and more convinced that offering our kid a relationship, a sibling indeed, is much better than all the fantastic opportunities we think we can offer him with money. Perhaps a child does not ask for things: he asks for you, he asks you to spend yourself for him. He wants your time, he wants you to watch him while he is doing something, he wants to feel worthy of your gaze. He wants and loves your wrinkles and white hair that even at the age of 27 begin to appear. Our children ask us the patience and - when it’s really used up - they love to see mom giving up and letting them watch the second cartoon of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis and its uncertainty are actually teaching me that you have to spend yourself for what is really worth it, without waiting for everything to be perfect. The crisis won’t take away your husband and your kids from you: they are your treasure and the only thing for which it’s worthy spending yourself. Taking control of your life and trusting Someone greater than you - God - isn’t crazy: it’s just another logic, it’s aiming for the maximum.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alessandra</name></author><summary type="html">Today a dear friend of mine from Spain commented my third awesome pregnant belly reproaching that only the Romanians, “los moros” and Gypsies get to the third child; and then “There are you guys, I just can’t get you”.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco&lt;/strong&gt; – I’ve got a very clear memory of the night before we started walking. We were seated next to a crumbling wall, surrounded by nature, admiring a magnificent sunset at the end of July. There the friar told us: “Don’t waste this opportunity: walk for something, walk to Assisi asking something to the Lord, something concrete.” Why was I there? I had just started the spiritual journey with Fr. Massimo, and after so much listening I needed to do something practical. Also, I like to put miles under my feet, so the pilgrimage was perfect. After all, if you are not able to soften your heart, the fatigue, the heat and the sore feet will do it for you … so in front of that sunset I asked the Lord to heal my relationships situation. This is why I was walking: in order to be healed from my disastrous love stories, the emotional failures and all those relationships that had never entirely closed (let’s remain friends?) … I was there for this, now I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alessandra&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting to the March was an endeavor. I was 16 and I was coming from a remote village in Basilicata, where sheep plus inhabitants don’t even get to eight thousand. I definitively wasn’t able to take a train by myself. I went there with my friend Giusy, who was older than me, and – most important - more experienced. The problem was that two days before the departure, Giusy didn’t feel like going anymore, but eventually, for my insistence, we ventured. My first memory of the March is the initial stage: 25 miles! Because of some accident we made two steps in one. Such an unspeakable enterprise for my legs, but especially for my “I am strong, I don’t leave my backpack, I take it, I’m not like the others, I can make it to the end” … and then first I left my backpack, and then humiliated I got on that dying-people-collector truck for the last miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco&lt;/strong&gt; - The first stop was devastating. Almost 25 miles. Heat, sweat, thirst. We arrived shredded at the destination, in groups of one or two people. At the arrival there were some bowls of fresh water waiting for us to regenerate our destroyed feet. And each one’s arrival was also a surprise for all of us. It’s amazing how sharing arises among people who have gone through the same “suffering.” It happens the same in fatigue sports, such as cycling and athletics. It was the same feeling: we made it, with our legs, with our sweat, with no shortcut, no recommendation. When defensive barriers are so low and masks of the everyday life fell on the street, talking and getting to know people is so easy! Fr. Massimo had “forbidden” me to start a new relationship before I had healed my wounds (and, in particular, before I had closed a situation on which my mind and my heart were still focused). I used to say to myself that I was in a period of “reclaiming”. But for this reason, having no expectations, it was natural to me to go to meet all (all) the girls in the March … On the evening of the first day, there was a small group of girls seated on the ground enjoying the well earned rest. Boldly I went there to know them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s your name?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alessandra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ok stored)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where are you from?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basilicata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(uhmmmm, it’s so far in the south of Italy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How old are you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sixteen, I just finished the third year of high school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(pffrrr … cof cof)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok let’s move on, I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alessandra&lt;/strong&gt; – During the walk, every now and then a guy appeared, a nice guy by the way. One day he said to me: “Hi Alessandra, I was looking for you, I wanted to walk a bit with you!”.  And I – who was in the “Santa Maria Goretti” phase -replied: “Um, ah, well….”, and I thought “Hey what the hell was his name? He calls me by name, maybe we talked before, but I don’t remember, so then who is he?”. But as the days passed, Francesco appeared more and more. The weird thing was that usually nobody used to flirt with my in my hometown, so I had become the “fun” one. But with him it was different: I didn’t have time or energy to be someone, so I was myself, all the way myself. The thing that helped me staying so calm was that it was clear to me that we were too different: Francesco was eight years older than me - which at sixteen years old makes a big difference; he graduated in physics (!!!!) and was doing his PhD (I ignored the meaning and existence of that word) in Zurich, and he was used to speak English with people. I, a random silly girl, was in the third year of high school, I lived in the village next to the one where Carlo Levi was confined, surrounded by goats, and I felt sophisticated when I spoke Italian instead of dialect. I was very surprised by the way Francesco saw things. When I talked with him I felt like I could catch some fresh air of freedom. He said: “You can enroll in a faculty that you think you might like. You commit yourself to it and you take your exams, and then after one year you stop and see if it really is what you want to do. If not, you can change faculty, what’s the problem?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco&lt;/strong&gt; - The days went by clear and serene. The silence of the morning, the daily rosary and the feet always full of dirt for the journey were giving me great peace. The destination was getting close: the &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary&quot;&gt;Porziuncola Church&lt;/a&gt; and the forgiveness of the Father. I don’t know if by chance or will, I spent much time with Alessandra. I enjoyed her simplicity and her purity -“I am the King’s most beautiful daughter”- , they were oxygen for me. They purified me from my boastful life, which was all focused in competing at work and in being the best and the smartest in everything. With Alessandra, instead, it was enough to be myself. It was enough to walk and talk. So, without realizing it, we reached the destination. The friar said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now you can kiss the ground”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we entered the Porziuncola. I shudder as I remember these moments. We entered together, side by side. We were in front of the Father. Many had tears of emotion, tears of joy. We made it, we did our run and we won: we kept faith as St. Paul says. And there the Father’s forgiveness was waiting for us, that forgiveness that He always wants to give, but that we so rarely ask. We were entering into the history, becoming a bit part of those old stones, which were there with St. Francis and his madness of love for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alessandra&lt;/strong&gt; - After the March I had planned to go to visit my sister in Rome, in order to take a few days of vacation. But when Francesco invited me to go with him I said “Well, I don’t know…”. The embarrassment was up, so I called my sister from a pay phone to tell her that I wouldn’t have gone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mary, look I won’t …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thank goodness you called! I have a problem at work: a girl left, so I absolutely need you to work with me tomorrow, thank goodness!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No, actually I’m calling you because …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You saved me! Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mary, look, I …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the cash ran out, the call disconnected and I couldn’t talk to my sister. Eventually, under a summer downpour, Francesco and I arrived at the Assisi station, and we left to Rome. Three unforgettable days. In the morning I worked with my sister and from lunch onwards Francesco showed me around Rome. We walked a lot. We prayed the rosary in every church we met on the Capitoline, or in St. Paul. It was a really nice, deep and pure friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco&lt;/strong&gt; - After the March, it was time to go back to the ordinary. But how was it possible after living such a moment of grace! Don’t ask me why, but I asked Ale to spend a few days in Rome with me. I wanted to show her my city, not as a tourist but as a Roman. There was no malice, no ulterior motives (for me the difference in age, but above all the different situations we were in: she in high school, me in Switzerland, were insurmountable). She was staying at her sister’s, and I took her around Rome with my bike for three days (true scenes from “Roman Holiday”). Three wonderful days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following months, Alessandra sent me a picture of S. Pietro from the Pincio, taken in those days. I spent so much time looking at that picture again and again. Maybe, in the bottom of my heart, … I had already guessed I had met the &lt;a href=&quot;\is-she-the-woman-of-my-life&quot;&gt;woman of my life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord listened to me. Not only He healed my wounds, but He made sure that Alessandra and I could meet many times in Assisi that year, just for an inexplicable series of God-incidences, which would have led us to start dating one year later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Francesco</name></author><summary type="html">Look up in the Glossary to see what the Franciscan March is.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://5loaves2fish.blog/images/posts/franciscan-march-2002.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Franciscan wedding plan, yes we can!</title><link href="http://5loaves2fish.blog/franciscan-wedding-plan-yes-we-can/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Franciscan wedding plan, yes we can!" /><published>2016-12-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-12-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://5loaves2fish.blog/franciscan-wedding-plan-yes-we-can</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://5loaves2fish.blog/franciscan-wedding-plan-yes-we-can/">&lt;p&gt;I heard this sentence a thousand times: “We can’t get married because we’ve got no money”, where by &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s meant that for the reception. So: first there is the dress, the restaurant, the flowers, the car, the historic church, the photographer, the entertainment, the honeymoon, etc. Then we should please her mum who couldn’t afford much in her days and now wants her daughter’s wedding to be the best one. And don’t forget her family is very large and they are a close family. So, just considering the most intimate ones, they are 150. And what about the little cousins, uncles, aunties, relatives here and relatives there, until the fifth generation on the mom’s side? Well it’s not nice not inviting them, they have been important for me… I absolutely have to find the aunt’s phone number… what was her name??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: &lt;strong&gt;planning a wedding is a huge stress and, if you think of it this way, it is only affordable to a few Sheikh oil kings.&lt;/strong&gt; But then, let me say, those poor souls that will have to come to this wedding and sit at the tables —which have already been planned by the groom on a night when he was finally free because he fought with his future bride for the color of the wedding announcement— how much will they have to spend for you? In fact at a wedding like this you need to be well dressed, and you can’t wear the dress that you recycled from your sister’s wedding: people can see it in the pictures and it’s embarrassing! And don’t forget the present! Oh gosh, the present! How much are these guys spending for us? At least 60$ per person for a piece of raw lasagna and a dessert that gives stomachache… damn, this means you’re forced to give 100$ each (at least!). Well, there are five of us, what can we do? I can foresee the vacation at the beach house skipping for a wedding, noooo!!! I know it: Chiara will certainly have a fever (even if it’s June), yes: a sudden illness because her grandparents took her to the mountains where there was a bad weather. We can’t give up the beach house for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start over!&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s start all over from the beginning. So, first of all, why are we getting married? Who has to absolutely be there that day? Who are we organizing this party for? &lt;strong&gt;Marriage is primarily a vocation&lt;/strong&gt;, a call to love and joy. It will surely be the best day of our lives, even without a mortgage to set it up (it will be the best day for the &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; it brings, not for the &lt;em&gt;emotions&lt;/em&gt; of the moment). It may have a better start with the rent paid for three months, instead of 15 minutes of fireworks. The main host, if we can call it so, will be the Lord. If He won’t be there everything will simply gets harder and harder. Then, let’s retrace the passages of the Gospel that have marked our history. A week before the big yes, let’s go on a nice retreat, just the two of us, in some hermitage to pray, to fully enter into the mystery of the sacrament we are about to receive. Perhaps during the celebration we can tell the story of providence and beauty that we experienced, so that everyone can be grateful to the Lord and help us to thank Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the organization? The lunch, the music, the dances … the party is for guests, but for sure we are the celebrated ones; so we ourselves need to have fun first. Following the standards perhaps doesn’t always reflect our personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-organize-a-beautiful-wedding&quot;&gt;How to organize a beautiful wedding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The announcement:&lt;/strong&gt; we took an A4 sheet and we used the printer at home, which works fine. We divided it into four parts. On the first side there was the invitation to the ceremony and the reception with a clear indication for the gift: “The Lord loves the cheerful giver. As a gift we would like a lot of money. Give what you can —and then Fr. Giovanni Marini forced us to add —and &lt;strong&gt;more than you can&lt;/strong&gt;. This money will be donated to an orphanage in Mozambique”. Below that there was a small map that showed how to reach the church and the reception place, and on the back we gave details about the mission in Mozambique. Alternatively, one can even use the invitations themselves to support those in need. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativelab.5p2p.it/&quot;&gt;we support the projects of Sant’Antonio church in Milan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dress:&lt;/strong&gt; on the Internet you can find really cheap stuff. I was lucky to have a mother who took on the role of dressmaker on the occasion, and so I just spent about 300$ for the fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flowers:&lt;/strong&gt; never say they are for a wedding, they’ll fleece you! Five days before the wedding, I went with my sister’s friend to buy 150 gerberas —my favorite flower— and she told the florist they were for a super-Franciscan wedding, meaning that he could not ask for more than 150$, and indeed it was so. At the wedding of a friend of mine, I’ve decorated the church myself: two or three compositions here and there, and a flower on each bench, tied with a ribbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photographer:&lt;/strong&gt; if you rely on a professional, in most cases you will end up with someone who ignores the deep meaning of that day. Lacking the necessary sensitivity, he will pretend to direct the day without really understanding your needs. Here are two solutions: the first is to give the role to a friend who has passion for photography and the necessary equipment. The second option is to call &lt;a href=&quot;http://weddings.5p2p.it&quot;&gt;5loaves2fish&lt;/a&gt; (yes! we also do that). In fact, the posts you are reading, the videos and our witnessing are completely funded by our wedding photography activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; location??? What? 5,000$? What? A parish hall is always easy to find, perhaps with a nice garden (which you’ll really enjoy, if it doesn’t rain —as it happened at our wedding— or you can do it at the country house of a cousin who lives out of town (in France they have this habit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch:&lt;/strong&gt; if the parish hall has a kitchen, you just have to add some scout friend who knows how to get by in any situation, or some volunteer who doesn’t want to give up the beach house to make you a gift; otherwise caterer, nice paper plates, plastic steam glasses and a bit of creativity. My father, for example, brought wine, my grandmother cheese, we bought some cold cuts from a farm, a friend made the cake, the caterer prepared a lasagna and the second course with a side (900€, waiters included, for 80 people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entertainer:&lt;/strong&gt; a friend who plays the piano bar, a good stereo, etc. Tarantella dance never goes out of fashion…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wedding-mobile:&lt;/strong&gt; as for the car, your cheap car works fine; polished as it was new, with hitched cans hung on the back, it looks cool ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, for our wedding we spent about 2,000$, including the offer for the church and the 10 nights we spent in the adjoining guesthouse. &lt;strong&gt;The most important thing is to put the most important things first&lt;/strong&gt;, and everything else around them. The most important thing is not to be sucked into this chasm of organization, and then look up. At our wedding many guests were in jeans, but we really enjoyed ourselves. The most beautiful gifts were the envelopes full of small change from my college friends, who really gave up a pizza for it and they did it from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes you can, what do you say?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alescanca</name></author><summary type="html">I heard this sentence a thousand times: “We can’t get married because we’ve got no money”, where by money, it’s meant that for the reception. So: first there is the dress, the restaurant, the flowers, the car, the historic church, the photographer, the entertainment, the honeymoon, etc. Then we should please her mum who couldn’t afford much in her days and now wants her daughter’s wedding to be the best one. And don’t forget her family is very large and they are a close family. So, just considering the most intimate ones, they are 150. And what about the little cousins, uncles, aunties, relatives here and relatives there, until the fifth generation on the mom’s side? Well it’s not nice not inviting them, they have been important for me… I absolutely have to find the aunt’s phone number… what was her name??</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://5loaves2fish.blog/images/posts/franciscan-wedding-plan-yes-we-can.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Is he the one?</title><link href="http://5loaves2fish.blog/is-he-the-one/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is he the one?" /><published>2016-12-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-12-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://5loaves2fish.blog/is-he-the-one</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://5loaves2fish.blog/is-he-the-one/">&lt;p&gt;And finally, where do I find such a superman willing to pursue me, pursue me? I still have adolescent acne, a butt which is larger than Texas and I have not yet learned how to upload pictures on the computer…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some answers for the first two questions, such as these: the perfect man does not exist in reality; or… perhaps I know one, but my friend took him while I was looking for a splinter in his eye. And again, maybe there is, and surely I’ll find him and he will fall at my feet, but no one believes it; actually neither do I. The answer to the third question was clear and firm: “No one would ever choose me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some thoughts; thoughts of teen Alessandra in her room as she looks at her new pimple in the mirror and says “hell!” In high school I was the friend of the &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; one. So I was the &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; one. &lt;strong&gt;That is, while I was thinking about the coolest guy ever of my life, no one cared about me.&lt;/strong&gt; If someone was flirting with me, he was just embarrassing. Actually I wasn’t much concerned about it because I really felt beautiful inside and my inner life was growing more and more in my deep relationship with God. This used to take a lot of space in my day, both in parish activities and in moments of solitude spent reading the psalms, often surrounded by nature under a big tree on top of a hill. The more space I gave to these things the more I felt fulfilled; so much so that I thought that all I wanted from life was to devote myself to God and to others. Yes, becoming a nun, that was the thing that gave me immense joy. So, after the example of St. Francis and with the enthusiasm of the friars and nuns that I spent time with in Assisi, I put on a pair of sandals, despite the cold of winter and the laughs of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father Giovanni, a friar who was my spiritual director, understood where I wanted to end up. And without even talking explicitly about it, he started saying stuff like “&lt;strong&gt;you must learn how to court a man first and then we can try to court God!&lt;/strong&gt;   So you have to court at least 10 guys and then choose the best. No fussing, look among the guys you already know. Go! Don’t forget that the man thinks with the eye: short skirt (very short indeed) heels, makeup, styled hair, etc. Hurry up!”. In fact I hadn’t had any important love story at that time (I was only 17!) So what he said made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now &lt;strong&gt;where do I find a guy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I find him, he will never want me! I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary&quot;&gt;Porziuncola Church&lt;/a&gt; and thought about whom of the friends in my life I looked up to and who could be worth having a story with. Immediately I thought of my friend Francesco, whom I had met the year before at the &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary&quot;&gt;Franciscan March&lt;/a&gt;, but with him it would have never worked. First of all, he belonged to the superman category. Also, he worked in Switzerland and was eight years older than me. Anyway, I took him as a benchmark; he represented the top. Then I made a deal with the Lord: “I am willing to court a man and put on skirts, heels, makeup and everything else only if he is a man (not a kid), that is more or less like my friend Francesco, from him up, I will not settle for less even to go drink a coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, though, a couple of months after that morning at the Porziuncola, Francesco began to call me and to pay attention to me. &lt;a href=&quot;/is-she-the-woman-of-my-life&quot;&gt;He too, was going on his own path&lt;/a&gt;. I began to engage in this relationship, in obedience to Father Giovanni’s suggestions. At first it was just to prove to myself that my life was somewhere else. What scared me most in having a relationship with a guy was that he could take me away from my deep relationship with God. I did not think something so intimate could be shared with anyone else. I fell in love with him head over feet. Not only I was wrong, but that intimacy deeply increased. It was all the more beautiful, more mature, more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: I met the right man at the Franciscan March, I recognized him as a man I respected in the Porziuncola, and I realized that he was the right one &lt;strong&gt;because he wasn’t perfect, but he could get in the game&lt;/strong&gt;. He made me breathe air of freedom when we were talking about the choices I had to do at the university, and, very importantly, he &lt;a href=&quot;/indeed-he-was-right&quot;&gt;knew how to argue and start again&lt;/a&gt; (which has been very useful) every time.&lt;/p&gt;

At that time I had already been through some serious love stories. However, although I enjoyed dating those girls, I never really considered starting a family or marrying any of them… I didn’t find any interest in such plan, because, let’s face it, family life is like a prison! A burdensome life where everything revolves around three things: work, children, and home, the whole package garnished with a car, vacations, and an annoying wife. No adventures, no challenges, no chance to engage with others. Not a fascinating perspective indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing my standpoint, Fr. Max invited me to go to meet a so-called christian &lt;strong&gt;family&lt;/strong&gt;. After a series of unsuccessful gentle attempts using good manners, the friar eventually convinced me with a kick in the butt! I was thinking: who are these people? I don’t even know them! And most importantly, what the hell do they know about me and my life? Despite these thoughts, I had nothing to lose and so I reluctantly decided to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed in Fiumicino (Rome) and drove for more than 4 hours to get to Manfredonia, Gargano, Puglia (south of Italy). Eventually, I arrived at &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary&quot;&gt;Mimmo &amp;amp; Cinzia&lt;/a&gt; Armiento’s place. It was August. The first morning we went to the beach, in the evening we ate pizza and on August 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, the day of forgiveness, we sang prayers. Among all, what I will never forget is a brief conversation I had with Mimmo. Sheltered from the heat under a tree, for the first time in my life I started imagining my future wife. Mimmo was asking me some questions, and he immediately got to the point. He asked me which relationships mattered the most in my life. I had no doubts. My friends from Rome I used to go rock climbing with: Piero, Claudio… why? I explained him: “… when you climb a mountain, you entrust your life to your rope partner. He is the one who holds the rope, he is the one will hold you if you fall. Our lives are held together by this mutual absolute blind trust”. In this view of relationships there was adventure, there was the courage of giving yourself up for the other 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimmo look at me and said “You know, my wife Cinzia is exactly this to me: &lt;strong&gt;she is my rope partner for life&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I heard these words, I was puzzled. I had never heard something like that. Especially about someone’s wife, who by definition is a pain in the a**, hysterical, obsessive, generally incompetent, psychologically unstable, always dissatisfied and overweight. In Italy there is even a song about it, which goes something like “Why? Why on Sundays do you always leave me alone? […] but one day I’ll come with you”; the perfect picture of an annoying woman; her husband’s response must have been “because at least on Sundays I can catch a breath! Even prisoners have yard time, don’t they?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my experiences, Mimmo’s words sounded like an epiphany. I had never thought or imagined that a wife could be a rope partner and a reliable good life companion. He invited me to think about what characteristics a hypothetical woman should have for her &lt;strong&gt;to be a good rope partner for my life&lt;/strong&gt;. And, as I was listing these qualities in my mind, I realized that the women I had dated so far did not embody pretty much any of them. This gave me confidence. So it is true, not all women are like that! There is a chance for me too to meet &lt;strong&gt;my rope partner!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been searching for the wrong person in the wrong places; but now I had a map. I started thinking of all my friends and acquaintances to see if, by any chance, one of them matched these new parameters. After pondering for a while, my search delivered one —one only— result… it was her. It is her. And I stayed up all night unable to sleep…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I called her and, shyly, we began our climb.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to figure out what that ring meant, he started by saying how important family is, how the values​​ he and my mom passed down to me are the foundation for life, and how commendable it was that Francesco and I were taking things seriously, BUT… :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alessandra you have to understand that the family is the most important thing. Family comes first, BUT you cannot improvise it: first you have to graduate, then you have to find a good job —maybe stable—, then don’t forget to save money in order to buy a nice house; and then you can get married.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Excuse me dad, but didn’t the family come first?! It seems it comes last, when you’ve done everything else. They don’t require you have a degree in order to get married, at most you need to have received Confirmation!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;… (Here I would put a picture of my dad stricken as if it was by lightning).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, necessary to soften the blow, my dad, moved, looked into the eyes of my mum and said: “We lost her”, meaning that he understood that in a short time I would have left home forever, that is I would have married soon. But actually the truth was different. The truth was that Francesco and I had already decided to get married. We had already set the date and booked the church. We had already made a promise of faithfulness to one another, followed by a brief blessing by Fr. Massimo. It happened one evening after praying the Vespers, at the altar of the &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary&quot;&gt;Porziuncola&lt;/a&gt; after everyone else had left the church, with a bouquet of scented red roses and only a few lit candles. We hugged and dreamt about all the things we wanted to do together as a married couple. We didn’t want to tell anyone because it seemed too precious, and, most of all, we knew it would have caused reactions and scandals. I am saying scandal because I was getting married at 19 years old (I would have become 20 a month after the wedding!), without a degree, without a steady job (especially if the only job involved is a researcher at the university!), without a house, and above all… without being pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the hurry? Why at 20 years old? Why not wait until everything is perfect? Why be so hasty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rush is the same that John and Peter had running together to the tomb to see Jesus resurrected (Jh20,4): the haste of explosive joy, of the love that can’t wait, impatient love, the love that asks you all of yourself. Love doesn’t ask you if you plan to graduate on time, or if you have economic stability. I don’t think that a marriage with a permanent job (if only it was easy to find!) is a better marriage.  Likewise, I don’t think that a marriage between two graduates has more value. But &lt;strong&gt;I definitely think that it takes three to get married successfully&lt;/strong&gt;, because in addition to the spouses there is a third: the Lord. Yes, I think a marriage with God is definitely better and more fun because you are not alone: you have someone who in the difficult times wants to get His hands dirty with you, who supports you when you make a mess, and who is your Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always asked God to give me the grace to spend my youth for my vocation. What I felt as urgent was not to waste time with anything that was a frill, but rather to &lt;strong&gt;hit the target as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. For me the target is God and my vocation is the way to serve Him, the place where I can spend myself, where I can meet Him. Why put something before joy, why wait?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love calls. Love is urgent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly eight years of marriage we don’t have a house, we don’t have a permanent job, and I did not graduate (my last exams are in July!). But we have more and more certainties: the chaos, always including, a huge pile of laundry to hang out, the presence of my husband next to me, our daily yes in joy and quarrels, our beautiful children with their chronic wildness, and providence. We lived in four different countries, with four different languages, we moved a thousand times, but we haven’t forgotten our goal, and that hurry hasn’t left us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alessandra</name></author><summary type="html">We were sitting at the table when my dad, struck at the sight of that ring, began a true father-to-daughter talk.
