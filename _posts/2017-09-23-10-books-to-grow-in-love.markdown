## 1. The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts 
### Gary Chapman
This book is absolutely the first of the list. A few years ago Father Giovanni practically forced  us to read it and study it... Gary Chapman summarizes the love languages of every person into 5 main modes. He teaches how to say **I love you** using the love language that your partner understands the most, in order to finally fill his need of love.

## 2. Brother Francis of Assisi 
### Ignacio Larranaga
At the beginning of my conversion, although I was very fascinated by St. Francis, I did not really know his story. This is the first book I read about him, recommended by Fr. Max during our first meeting. It is a fascinating narrative about  the conversion and life of St. Francis in an in-depth but agile and flowing style. If you want to go beyond the idea of Francis as the Saint who loved the birds you have to read it.

## 3. I married you

## 4.The Screwtape Letters 
### Clive S. Lewis
Screwtape is a devil who, in a series of letters, suggests and teaches his pupil Wormwood how to try and divert his **patient** from the inspirations of the **Enemy** (God) and his Son (Jesus). It is a genius work that reveals in how many subtle ways we can be distracted from the Lord and his Will despite we are doing holy things. Thanks to this book, I realized for the first time how my way of living the faith was totally immature. A must!

## 5. The way of a pilgrim 
### Anonymous writer
"By the grace of God I am a man and a Christian, by my actions I am a great sinner, by vocation I am a pilgrim", this is how the book begins. It is about a man’s search on how to pray **incessantly**, following the exhortation of St. Paul (1 Thess.15,17). This book has helped me a lot in my spiritual journey, making me discover a new aspect of my dialogue with God that I was not familiar with: **the prayer of the heart**. A pilgrimage of the soul that is fascinating to discover.

## 6.Introduction to the Devout Life 
### St. Francis de Sales
This little book represents a practical guide for the faithful who decides to be serious about the Lord. The part that struck me the most is certainly the one that describes the choice between Paradise and Hell that we make every day with our actions. In fact, the mind tends to postpone this thought as if it was something that could be decided at the last moment. Francesco of Sales instead, opens our eyes on how each step is important to get to our **final goal**, and how every step should always be weighted in view of the eternal life. An unbeatable classic, highly recommended.

## 7.Confessions 
### Saint Augustine
When you look at the lives of saints, their actions and their deeds, you often end up thinking, **"all right but that was a saint, that’s why he was able to do certain things..."**. After all, it's a great way to justify our shortcomings. In his Confessions, Saint Augustine tells us the story of his conversion in an authentic and profound manner. He describes how he went from being a successful speaker, lover of pleasure and women, to one of the founding fathers of our faith.

## 8. Orthodoxy 
### G.K. Chesterton
The book is the outline of the personal journey of the author. About 15 years before entering the Catholic Church, he found in the Church his home amidst the unfamiliar, like an "English yachtsman who slightly miscalculated his course and discovered England under the impression that it was a new island in the South Seas.” With his unique wit and humor, G.K. Chesterton turns inside out the beautiful and wild adventure of walking through life together with Christ and his Church. Joining him in his exploration, one can learn that “the outer ring of Christianity is a rigid guard of ethical abnegation and professional priests; but inside that inhuman guard you will find the old human life dancing like children, and drinking wine like men; for Christianity is the only frame for pagan freedom. But in the modern philosophy the case is opposite; it is its outer ring that is obviously artistic and emancipated; its despair is within.” Ultimately, and most importantly, one discovers that “joy, which was the small publicity of the pagan, is the gigantic secret of the Christian.” Highly recommended.

## 9. The secret diary of Elizabeth Leseur 
### Elizabeth Leseur
How does true love look like? How is it possible to love your spouse when you really don’t understand each other or you get nothing in return?
This book is an answer to these or similar questions.
Elizabeth Leseur was married to a man, Felix, who opposed and ridiculed her faith. They lived in a very secular society, the French aristocracy of the early 20th century, which was at best completely indifferent to her belief and often strongly against it. Her diary is the account of how she found in her very circumstances and in her suffering her unique opportunity to grow in love. It is a witness of how she let her marriage work on her own holiness and true happiness, and therefore a wonderful testimony to the purpose of every marriage. After her death, Felix found the diary and was slowly but strongly moved by how she gave her life for him, in silence and through her otherwise ordinary life: he converted, and ended his life as a faithful Catholic priest. Elizabeth’s diary was published by Felix, who included his own witness of how the love of his wife had changed him. A must, especially (but not only!) for wives and women discerning a vocation to married life.

## 10. The Jerusalem Bible
Finally, the book that has more value than every other. What I like the most about the Bible of Jerusalem are the notes to the side that help a lot in the lectio divina. As Fr. Fabio Rosini says, the Bible explains the Bible. In fact, for each line there are the side references to other Bible’s chapters where the same topics are treated (such as parallelisms among the various Gospels, or the Old Testament references that help to understand the New Testament). This pocket edition is called the pilgrim edition: it is a truly great travel companion.
