title: When it looks like there is no way out
date: 2017-11-06 00:29:00 Z
summary: I’m always inclined to think in a schematic and rational manner. Once I have
  defined the starting point, once I’ve set the target, my mind has already pictured
  the ideal route to get to the destination. Regularly, I get disappointed. Every
  single time my ideal path gets deflected and amended, making me sad and discouraged.
  I’m not the only one in this situation; it’s a kind of everyone’s drama. But is
  it really a bad thing?

It could be due to the bad weather and the way my mood gets affected by rain, or to the many objective problems we will soon have to face (or perhaps the unstoppable race to the 40s...), but we are feeling close to a dead end. Trust gives way to fear; the fear of not believing and not seeing Him. It looks like there is no way out. Not only it *looks* so: there is no way out.

Getting out of the hamster cage, that cage of our securities, out of our square (or what we made ours because we were too afraid to break a scheme), is certainly no picnic in the meadows. Or rather, sometimes it is, and then you feel the wind blowing in your face and the sun warming up your heart. At other times instead, you feel more like Rambo, when he rushes into the forest and hides in the trunks with a flaming torch in his hands. There is no path to find there. There just isn’t one. It’s not pleasant, it’s not comfortable and it’s dark.

Faith gives way to fear.

Phrases like "you’ll never make it," "you've got it all wrong", "you are worthless" flash through your mind. And you wonder at what crossroads of life you missed the right turn. Just like when you are on the freeway, and you miss your exit and the gps kindly suggests you to make a U-turn as soon as possible (in this case the wisdom of my wife prevails on technology, forbidding me to make unlikely maneuvers and suggesting to keep on straight). Sure enough, there is always an exit close by, which brings us safely to destination with a simple re-routing. Now I know, and with careless disregard I wait for the gps to find a new route. Indeed, it even happened that the alternative route was better than the one it originally planned. Sometimes, in this way, we have found ourselves in unknown places, sometimes very beautiful and romantic, places that we wouldn’t have known following the traditional way. Sometimes getting lost has been an opportunity.

Is it the same in life?

As the gps uses a very limited number of parameters to compute the "optimal" route, so our head creates expectations about life with a way too small number of elements... that's why I put that drawing at the beginning of this post. Take a look at it. This could be the ideal representation of my life. In my head, the path is fairly linear. Perhaps milestones along the way could be called "finish the studies", "buy a house", "get married", but also "travel", "succeed". The point here is that everything should be achieved through a sequence of consequential stages. The road I have traveled, instead, is different. It may look like a mess of aimlessly trails, a constant going back to the same spots, the same struggles, the same failures. In this journey there are also a thousand accidents —and especially a thousand surprises— that have made my life rich. Unexpected facts, which I couldn’t foresee. This is how I met some of the most important people in my life, first of all my wife Alessandra. This journey includes also all the times we had to move... and then [the gift of faith]({{site.baseurl}}/my-conversion), which arrived on top of a series of "random” and unlucky events.

>> Your ways are not my ways, says the Lord - Is 55.8

I look back and it's [time to remember]({{site.baseurl}}/happiness-is-a-choice). It’s time to remember *where* you went through, where the Lord has brought you through. "You will tread on the lion and the cobra" (Psalm90) but "The gates of hell shall not prevail" (Mt16,18). This is the Lord's promise.

I’d like to end this post sharing a concrete experience.

For me and Alessandra it was not easy to decide to get married. We didn’t have any kind of certainty but the journey we had made and the desire to continue it together. Getting married seemed impossible. I was working in Zürich and my contract was almost over, while Alessandra was studying in Rome. Since she was there, my desire was to go back to my hometown Rome, and start our life together there. Living in Switzerland would have been too hard at that time, but finding a job in Rome was as easy as climbing the Grand Canyon like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. The road was hidden, actually there was none. "Just keep having faith!" Jesus said to the head of the synagogue whose daughter was dying. And so we did.

First, we set the wedding date. Then we got officially engaged, and finally we booked the Church. The essential. With no job. No house. Without the support from our families. It actually seemed there was no future for us... but in our hearts we had the joy of responding to our vocation.

Time passed, Alessandra was studying in Rome, while I was still in Zürich. Then everything happened quickly when, a few months later, a guy from Rome, “randomly” met at a conference, told me that there was an open position at his lab. My profile was perfect. It was a Saturday. The following Monday I had a position in Rome. We had tried a thousand different ways, and a thousand doors had been slammed in our faces (actually I would say on our teeth). And then in the most unlikely place (I was in Portugal), with no expectations, the situation got unlocked. With that job we could pay the rent; it opened a way. The Lord gives you the necessary, not the superfluous. The same happened at other times, like when two years later we were leaving Rome, or when we were in France, in a deep crisis. It happened the same thing in every dry and difficult time in our lives.

I look back, I remember and I can see we have actually walked on lions and cobras, and that really doors that did not exist were opened.

Today I want to embrace Jesus’s words "Just keep having faith." I will do so.

And you?
