Honestly, my love stories never made much sense before I met Alessandra. There are many reasons why, but I think one in particular is very important, and it is valid for everyone: the lack of a *free* heart.

Beginning a love story means engaging, giving yourself up, embarking on a long journey whose path you basically ignore. This, however, doesn’t mean that you can go blindly: *in love you have to be an initiate*, you cannot improvise a love relationship, so much as you cannot act as a rock climber if you are not one. Having a free heart is the first assumption to start this adventure.

Free from what?

Free from assumptions and prejudices about how the other or your relationship should be. But mostly, free from the ghosts of the past. Each one of us carries some in their heart. The girl from high school, the guy you first made love with or just an old flame you've never completely turned off. In fact, these flames can be switched off... you do not have to, and you cannot wait for them to go away by themselves. *Love is a choice*. And the first choice to make is to have you heart free from the ghosts of the past. What is the consequence of not doing that? All the love stories you will start afterwards, no matter how beautiful the person you are living them with, will only be a palliative to fill that hole in your heart, or a basis for comparison that will be there to judge the newborn love.

Our spiritual director, Fr Giovanni, calls this problem "the lack of elaboration of the ghost of the other", and rightly rates it as one of the most devastating poison for a love story. These wounds of the past prevent you from seeing the other for what he/she is and to totally give yourself to him/her.

How to get rid of this chain? First, by recognizing it for what it is: a lie about you. "All things work together for good to those who love God" (Rm8). Everything can be a grace in the hands of the Lord. It’s not true that with that past love story you lost the woman or man of your life. It‘s not true that without that person your life makes no sense. And —most importantly—, you don’t have to find a person like the one you've lost... indeed, the fact that that story didn’t work out should make you re-think about what you really need.

Personally, this was the number one issue that prevented me from entering a love story. In fact, only when I saw how deep the cave of my wounded affection was, I was able to get into a mature [love story]({{site.baseurl}}/is-she-the-woman-of-my-life).

My story is simple. Like so many, after some flirts in the early years of high school, I met a girl. We were cute together, we were simple and we used to spend our Saturday afternoons wandering carefreely through the streets of Rome. We dreamed of having a farm with many animals and to stay together forever. Then we grew up and we were too unprepared to see that our lives were growing apart. I was not completely satisfied with that infantile –and a bit morbid– relationship, but in my head our love story was everything. Then came that night when she broke up with me. I was 20 years old and my life was upside down. I suffered like a dog. For m-o-n-t-h-s. I was terrified by the possibility to meet her in the aisles of the university. I didn’t attend classes anymore, and I didn’t give exams. My life was literally paused for more than 6 months. I was stuck.

It was not easy to get up from that and I did it creating an armor of pure meanness around me. I had this motto: if they hurt you, you hurt them even more. For the next three years, I behaved like a huge asshole (sometimes you have to say it!). In fact, I had several other love stories, all of which were more or less without a goal. I was going on blindly, [until I met the Lord]({{site.baseurl}}/my-conversion) who picked me up from the mud. After the first experiences at the [Ten Commandments]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary), I found [Assisi]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary). I met Fr Max and asked him to be my spiritual director. The first thing he told me?

> You need a reclamation.

What? He meant no more love stories until I had solved my *problem* with the past. I didn’t understand what he meant, until he candidly made me notice that I was still keeping a memory box from that famous love story. There was everything in it: letters, gifts, photos, and all sorts of objects that had characterized that story. It was the forbidden temple, completely taboo.

> Here, go and throw it away as soon as you get home.

What!? The friar was asking me to throw away the forbidden temple, the taboo box! Acting with violence —great violence— against myself, I did it. I went back to Rome, took the box and put it in the trash bin.

I made a *choice*.

I chose it with the Grace of God, because wouldn’t have ever been able by myself. Each step that followed came as natural result of that choice. Few weeks after, I left [for the Franciscan March]({{site.baseurl}}/franciscan-march-2002), and there a friar enlightened me about why I was there: "Don’t waste this opportunity, walk for something. Ask the Lord something great." And I asked the Lord to heal my affective life. Without knowing, I put in His hands what is the pivot of a man's whole life: to feel loved and to love. That choice allowed me to meet [Mimmo and Cinzia]{{site.baseurl}}/glossary) with whom I understood why that first story ended, and above all I understood what I was looking for. For the first time, I was free from the ghosts of the past.

The Lord listened to my prayer and (as usual) He did it in His own way.

At that point I was ready.
