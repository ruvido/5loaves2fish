title: Happiness is a choice
date: 2017-10-10 14:25:00 Z
summary: So much trouble looking for it, yet it's never even close. You crave it but
  you don’t act as if you wanted it. You see it in others, you dream of it, you experience
  it for an instant, and then you lose it again for a trifle. Beyond any pretence,
  when asked "what do you want most in your life?", we all answer "to be happy". Now
  is the time to choose it. Keep reading.

The train of life has passed and you've missed it. Your chance is gone. Just like that love story you use to believe in: you really thought it was the turning point of your life, instead last night it ended with a "let's keep in touch". Perhaps sorrow knocked at your door; a loss, a dear person left you when you still needed them, just like that, unforeseen, in the silence of the night. Or even more simply, you look at yourself in the mirror and you are disgusted. You are disgusted by your body, by the way you are, the way you have been living, that wound that doesn’t heal. And so you tell yourself that *life* is this way and that’s it, that happiness is not for you. You start approaching your life with detachment, perhaps with cynicism, or victimism — life is so unfair. And you start with the same old story full of *if only*... if only my father... if only at school... if, if. You’d like to get out of this death trap, but there seems to be no way.

Here, let me announce you a great joy!

Happiness does not depend on the events of life, on your success, on your failures, and not even on your body. This doesn’t come just from me. Think about the peace of mind of the saints in front of diseases, in front of death (!). Read the Canticle of the Sun, written by St. Francis during the most painful moments at the end of his life, when he was double over in pain ("Most High, Almighty, Good Lord..."). Or consider all the mothers who have faced death happy to give their lives, like [Chiara Corbello](http://www.chiaracorbellapetrillo.it/2013/07/07/chiara/). Or even [Nick Vujicic](http://www.lifewithoutlimbs.org/about-nick/bio/), born with no arms, and no legs. Look at his smile, look at his joy... where does it come from? What does he have that you don’t?

I was also closed in my sadness when I heard these words for the first time:

> Rejoice in the Lord always! The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything. (Phil 4: 4-6)

Paul uses the imperative **rejoice**. This is not a tip, an advice — it's an order! It's a choice to make. Ezekiel was told the same thing:

> “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord God, you know.” Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. (Ez 37: 3-5)

Prophesy means to go beyond this pain, this lack. Look at God's plan!

In front of these words you can have two kinds of reactions. The first one can be summarized with the expression — *yah right*. Critics like, "then give me back my loved one," or "then cure my disease," or "I can’t make it, it's not for me." I mean, do you really think that Paul the Apostle or the people he was preaching to were in a better situation than you are?... The second reaction instead, is that of **listening**. Listening with the heart. Because in depth of the heart these words sound true, they sound desirable. You really wish they were *in fact* true, you wish they could be happening in your life. You don’t know how to do it, you don’t know where to start from, maybe you're afraid to believe in all of this (I bet!). Yet deep in your heart you’d want these words to be true for you.

When I found myself at this crossroad, I *decided* to shut up my inner saboteur and I began to believe that this announcement was in fact for me, that it could be realized in my own life. You know what, if you take this road you are already prophesying on the dry bones of your life. Looking back I see two things that helped me walk in this direction: praying and recognizing the action of the Holy Spirit in my life.


## Pray

"In order to take the way we should take, which way should we take?" Here's how the Italian comedian Totò makes fun of so many of our questions. The Lord Himself is "plenished joy" (Ps 15) so let’s start from Him. Let’s start by seeking Him, meeting Him, but first and foremost by **listening** to Him, with the certainty that He is already knocking at your door. How can we do it? Start with simple things: daily mass, liturgy of the hours, the Gospel of the day; it doesn’t matter what you do, just do something. Base your prayer on the Word, on the assiduous attendance to the Word. Reading the Word is what matters: listen to what He has to say about your life. The Lord knows all your sufferings, so be silent: it's time to listen. Spend time **every day** with the Word of God. You can start, for example, from the daily Gospel and then move on and **examine** the scriptures using the references to related passages (see [Jerusalem Bible]({{site.baseurl}}/10-books)).

Let the Word read your heart, you will find yourself to be struck by certain passages. Write them down on a notebook and mark the date. If you want, you can also add a brief comment on why you were struck by that specific passage. When you are struck by a passage, keep it in your heart and repeat it throughout the day. Live your days in the *light* of that passage (*Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path*. Ps 118) 


## Recognize the story of your salvation 

The second crucial point is memory. Consider your story with its failures and disappointments and begin to re-read those facts with God's eyes. What do they mean? Everything in life has a meaning. The disappointments throughout my life have led me to write these words *today*. If I hadn’t experienced that sadness, I wouldn’t be here now writing to you. In the same way, what you went through has shaped you as a man and as a woman. What you are *now* is what you can offer to your brothers and sisters. 

To remember means especially to see how the Word has guided your steps over the years. If you can’t remember any passage that struck you in the past, it is a sign that you have get stronger with prayer and with listening to the Word. As a matter of fact, the Lord speaks to all those who **listen** to Him with sincere heart (Ps 144; it is necessary be in silence in order to hear clearly). 

If you walk down this path with **perseverance** and **determination**, you will grow stronger in prayer and in memory until they will become the same thing. They will build one on the other bringing light and clarity in your life. **Happiness is a choice**, let the journey begins. It starts **today**.
