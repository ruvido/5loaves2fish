Inside the Church there are two main "categories" of Christians: the *super bigots* who meticulously follow the Church’s guidelines, the pope and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and the *loosey-goosey* Christians, who are those we-believe-in-God but the important thing is to love each other without hurting anyone (which turns into each one adjusting their faith to their liking).

The formers sometimes follow a script and the latters... **as well**! But does following the Lord and being part of the Church mean to belong to one of these two categories? Sincerely, I don’t see myself in either of them. And it’s not a matter of taste: when I’ve had to face real questions in life, difficult or important choices, neither the bigots nor the loosey-gooseys have — ever — been useful in my discernment. I don’t want to criticize any of these two ways because in the end I think that both stem from a protective and self-reassuring attitude. *Being part of a group* makes us feel good. But at the same time it inhibits us and prevents the deeper region of ourselves from emerging to respond to the **personal call** of the Lord:

>> There are people who you alone will be able to love, things that you alone will be able to do, feelings that you alone will be able to feel. In Christ's name, be yourself! (Fr. Fabio Rosini)


Having bigoted and *Christian-Of-The-Year* mentality is a way to hide behind a barricade of untouchable dogmas in the hope of protecting ourselves from the attacks of the world. Standing on a pedestal one stops wondering...just follow the script. By being *loosey-goosey* on the other hand, we belittle the Church and its millennial wisdom, the beauty of obedience and in some cases the importance of "not understanding" and letting yourself be guided by those who are ahead of you on the way.


## My personal experience

As far as I'm concerned, I have experienced many situations in which every predefined answer was insufficient and felt inadequate. For example after a year and a half of marriage, I was feeling particularly frustrated. And I felt like a complete failure just by admitting it. Listening to the answers of the rigorous and the loosey ones made it even worse. On one side they told me I had to hold strong; how was it possible that I was following the Lord’s call and feeling frustrated? I had flopped! On the other side, the answer was clear: "You have to get a job! Isn’t it so clear?". I didn’t think I had flopped, I didn’t think that God was mocking me and I didn’t want to leave my six-month-old daughter in someone else’s hands.

What could I do?


## God made us unique and breathtaking!

The thing about being Christian is that you put your life in God's hands so that a masterpiece may come out of it, with **a beauty and a fullness that you could have never imagined**, even in your highest expectations on yourself. The point is that there is never a predefined rule to face life’s events, but there is always a way to move forward, a path designed specifically for you to discover. Because behind every difficulty, every suffering, every *brokenness*, **there is a grace to experience**. God loves you not only because He is good but because He created you! He conceived you the exact way you are! With that button nose and that messy story. Because the world cannot function without you. **You are important!**

And unique.

Think about the saints. Think about St. Francis, St. Chiara, Curé d'Ars. Think about St. Augustine, St. Paul. Oh, try to find two who were the same! One was ignorant, one embraced poverty, one was literate and well-educated, one traveled to evangelize the whole world, one did not move from his cell, some were killed, others were acclaimed, they were all different! These people became saints because with the Lord they discovered their profound identity. They wanted to know at any cost where the Lord wanted them to be. I heard that before her call Mother Teresa of Calcutta had this dialogue with the Lord. Looking at the poor on the streets:

>> "Lord, why don’t you think of them?!" And the Lord answered, "I have thought of you for them."

Do you understand?

The saints took their life, as a white page, and gave it to the Lord so that He could write on it, and turn it into a masterpiece. They let their plans be ruined, they went off the grid!


## The love recipe

There is just one thing that is common in all the saints: **their love for the Lord**. This is the path we are called to walk down: the cross of the South. What I learn from these witnesses of happiness is to stay on my knees in front of any situation: "*Lord I want to stay with You, I want to live of You in this situation. Show me the way. I know you are the ultimate good and you think the best for me*".

**This is to say that the answers are never predictable**. For example: if you have been dating for five years now, then you have to get married; if you are thinking of taking a job and leave your baby to the pre-kindergarten, you are not a good mother; if you have a kid, you have to have many others; if your husband neglects you, you have to carry this cross... what are you talking about?! Solutions from the good-Christian script have never helped anyone. What helps is to kneel in front of the Lord, to pray, and then be creative, to look for concrete support (such as a couple of friends or a priest who works with couples) even when it comes to travel for miles.

Going back to my personal experience, I have found the answer while on my knees, in prayer. In front of the Lord firstly I could admit my feelings, although expressing them was painful. Then I listened to others. Then I prayed. In the end, with this confidence and in total darkness, I realized that I had to spend some time with myself, with no child and no husband. And it worked because I was there for them but at the same time I knew I also had to love myself. But the answer came in the silence, and it turned out to be a unique solution specific to my situation.

I have written all of this to say that **only God can tell you the truth about your life**. To understand it you have to be kneeling, let yourself be guided by a spiritual father you trust, stay close to the sacraments every day and read about how the Church responds to these needs, in its wisdom handed out over the centuries. The do-it-yourself way will surely leave you in doubt and with a handful of banalities, and it won’t lead you to the summit of happiness — and therefore holiness.

It doesn’t matter what life circumstances you find yourself in today. Whether you are married and have five kids, whether you are not understanding anything, it doesn’t matter: go before God, stay in His presence, be patience and perseverant, seek Him in your heart as St. Augustine did and you will find the way.

Again, I think God made us unique and awesome!
