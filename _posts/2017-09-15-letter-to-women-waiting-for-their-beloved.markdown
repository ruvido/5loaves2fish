title: Letter to women waiting for their beloved

summary: I have always believed that the success of a love story depends on many uncontrollable
  factors, often decided by chance. Later, I realized that things were not quite so;
  in particular, that a love story is built long before meeting the beloved one!

These days I meditate on the Book of Ruth. The heart of this story is the beauty of this woman, Ruth, who is capable of love. She does not abandon her mother-in-law Naomi, who would have been otherwise doomed to a life of hunger. She is a woman able to leave her homeland (Moab) to go with her. She is a woman who engages herself, is generous, determined, intelligent. Ruth is a woman who gives her all. With these attributes, she journeyed to Bethlehem. Once she had arrived, Ruth went to *glean* in the fields (i.e. to collect what's left on the floor from the crop) to feed herself and Naomi. It is precisely in this act of extreme humility and generosity that Boaz, the owner of the field, noticed her. Ruth proves to be a surprisingly mature woman **capable of love**. These will be her credentials to blow up the love in Boaz’s heart.

Here's the point.

According to our spiritual director,  Fr. Giovanni, this book provides **the pillars to build a healthy and mature love story**. Ruth stands out, yet is not noticed for her flamboyance or external beauty. Nor is she noticed for her intelligence, or for her speaking. Ruth stands out because she spends herself in a mature way. She devotes herself with love to situations of need. **She knows how to love!** There is no [childish hysterical-nurse syndrome]({{site.baseurl}}/women-by-vocation-nurses-by-nature). Ruth does not save the world, does not want to change people, does not want to give something of herself: she begins to **serve in basic needs**. Here you do not take applauses or awards.

The wonderful thing about this story is that Ruth has no further motive. She doesn’t think it is a good strategy or about her own advantage. She does not think she is giving a good impression. Ruth thinks about doing good. She looks at what is needed. Her eyes and her heart are facing upwards. And that **makes people around her fall in love**. This approach provides the guarantee for beauty. It encourages and invites people to get to know her, to enter into a relationship with her, because she **is** beautiful, not just because she  appears beautiful outwardly. It is because she gives off that fragrance of beauty one doesn’t want to give up. Her smile and her eyes are fascinating and beautiful because they are pure.

Many times my wife Alessandra asked me "what made you fall in love with me?"... And I, a little embarrassed, used to say "your pure eyes." Today, reading and meditating Ruth’s story, I understand my heart better. I understand that those beautiful eyes come from a lived past: a life close to Him; a life made up of hours of prayer and catechism spent teaching to 40 children who Jesus was; a life spent dancing and singing and taking care of the sick neighbor child. It was a life even made of many humiliations that she willingly accepted.

Father Giovanni writes: "Who can put a partner in our arms if we are not trained to love? It is essential to learn to love in the first place, then we will be able to become *beautiful* through dedication and sacrifice, and in the end able to get married. The truly beautiful person is the one who loves, sacrifices herself for others, gives herself. There is no other beauty. And you can be beautiful in all seasons of life. Boaz was surprised when Ruth did not choose a young stalwart, showy and rich man, but him, although a bit on in years."

I've experienced this. I fell in love because I saw in Alessandra the ability to love and be gratuitous. But I myself had not experienced it. I simply sensed it observing her eyes during the long walks of the [Franciscan March of 2002]({{site.baseurl}}/franciscan-march-2002).

So you realize that the success of a love story is played **today**, even if you haven’t met your spouse yet. It is played today in the exercise of love; a mature and selfless love. It is played in the humility with which you face this day of work or study. It is played in forgiveness and prayer and in your ability to **receive** love from God, which is —and should be— your main source of beauty. And it is clear that you want to be **completely beautiful**... so go with the skirt and some make-up, as Father Giovanni says! But make no mistake of being an empty amphora, or —on the contrary— too full of yourself. **Be full of Him**.

This is true for men too. It is a necessary reciprocity. You women can be fascinated by a pure man too, who works on himself and waits for you. It can be done! Ten years before he met his wife Lia, Paul recited this spontaneous prayer every day:

> My God, I consecrate my wife to You. Wherever she is, guard her, guide her and protect her. Bring her on a good path. I consecrate her to your Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. - Paul

Let us walk every day doing our best. Let us work tirelessly to build our own person. Let us learn to love through the daily gift of ourselves, knowing that God listens to our hearts. Let us ask great things, not have under-developed desires!!

Have a good journey with Him!
