+ He is a really insensitive person, he totally doesn’t realize how much he hurts me with that classic chauvinist attitude.
+ Well, he’s from south of Italy… maybe it’s part of his culture and he doesn’t do it on purpose, maybe it's just a cultural attitude.
+ *No! No! Alessandra, it’s not like that! That's really him! He never understands me! He doesn’t listen to me at all! I do not feel loved by him! He never takes decisions! He is not consistent in his choices! He says one thing and then he pulls back right away! And then... and then... and then...*
+ Excuse me, then why are you dating him?
+ *Well, because he's a good guy!*

I often talk to dating couples and I hear things like that. And each time, when the final answer "because he's a good guy" arrives, it reminds me of a lady from my town who used to praise his son for being so careful, and so thoughtful for putting such an effort in looking for a job. But actually her "good guy" had left his wife for a young woman and didn’t take care at all of his three-year-old child, and he was living at his mom’s house, letting her provide for him. So much for being a good guy!!!

Another common answer is the mystic one: "You know, she's important for me because she introduced me to the Lord! I've never had a Christian date before her." This deceives many couples. A Christian engagement is definitely much better because, thanks to chastity, you have a chance to get much more in depth in the relationship and to establish some respect towards the other. BUT… this is not enough. It’s not enough to be Christian in order to get married, or to agree about chastity and go to Sunday Mass. This is not enough! More is needed! Love is needed: caring for one another, respect, desire to be together, wonder, discovery, surprise, adventure, effort, forgiveness, etc.

I would never, ever marry a “good guy”. I want someone who doesn’t see anything but me. Someone who would leave everything for me, who wouldn’t take even half a millisecond to say that with me, he is the happiest man on the planet and he cannot die until he marries me. So for less than "You are the woman of my life! I love you! Do you want to you marry me?" with a huge bouquet, I'm not in. The world is full of good guys and, even if a bit less, even of Christian guys. I want a guy who loves me, who takes the challenge, who lets his plans be messed up, who really knows how to love as God, who does not hesitate to get his hands dirty. In short: the best! For less than this, it is not worth the effort to date.

For me this is Francesco. I married him because he was a man and not a boy, because he put aside his career to make sure that we could spend time together and get married in a place that was familiar to me. I married him because he is able to reinvent himself, to take the challenge, to forgive me and also because one night, taking me home, he told me: "my life is not fully happy until I ask you if you want to marry me. Do you want to marry me?".

Our choices have often been considered crazy, not good-guys choices, and we know even worse couples, who are on their way towards marriage even without a job. The question is whether this relationship you are in is a relation of love, joy, beauty, or is bringing you only stress, heaviness and hard time trying to make it work at all costs just because in the end “she has what it takes”, and “she is even Christian”? Love is not a matter of effort; it is a matter of love, respect, beauty.
