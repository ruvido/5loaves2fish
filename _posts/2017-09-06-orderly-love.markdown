*This article has been written after a discussion with our spiritual director and it seemed to us very fruitful to share it here.*

In everyday language, we often talk about giving and receiving love, as if love involved something to give. But what is one supposed to give exactly? Is it something of myself that I should give? If it was that, as wonderful as it might be, it would always be something limited, that goes by with time. Is this the kind of love you want to give? Here is the heart of the matter and this is where the concept of **orderly** love comes into play. In fact, the Church teaches us that there is an order of priorities, functional to love, that enables us to fully live the calling to marriage (but these principles are valid for every kind of vocation) and helps us finding the right path in our journey to Love.

Here are the three key points of this priority list.

## 1.LOVE FOR GOD

He loved us first and has always been loving us. He is the One who wrote the rules of the game and knows us to the core. He is the Love. Therefore, He is the touchstone and the inspiration of what is love and of how it is given. Moreover, from Him we draw love. From Him first we need to feel loved and then, after having experienced that, we can turn to others. We are only vehicle of God’s love: we receive it to give it back. We are not passive: we have to give our five loaves and two fish, we have to fill the jars (as in Cana), but He will be the One who multiplies them and turns water into wine, only Him.

Therefore, the most important step to learn love is spending time with the Beloved, first by letting Him love you. Spend daily time in silent prayer with Him. For example when you get up in the morning, while you are in your car in a traffic jam or in the evening before you to go to bed. Spend that time alone with Him, not asking for something but praising, thanking Him and being grateful. He will answer.

## 2. LOVE FOR YOUR BRIDE OR GROOM

Once you put the relationship with God, your true Spouse, into the foreground, the love you receive from Him needs to be orderly directed towards others. In marriage, the closest “other” is the husband or wife, loving him or her  is our vocation. Loving the people who need our help and even our children does not come before that. The spousal relationship needs to have the first place. This relationship is an image of the spousal relationship with Jesus we are all called to, whether single married or consecrated. This is the place where we will spend ourselves the most in loving. There we will give the love that we have received through our relationship with Jesus Himself. Our vocational call is accomplished first and foremost in this relationship. On this, we will be called to give account when we are in front of the Boss. In fact, it is not important to do good, but to accomplish God’s will. Having saved thousands of children in Africa neglecting your wife or husband prevents us from living our vocation to the fullest. Going to all the meetings in the parish, winning the medal catechist of the year 2014 and never skip the morning prayers, the vespers and the litany after the Rosary with the old ladies at 18.00, is useless if to do that you miss the goals scored by AS Roma sitting on the couch next to your husband.

## 3.LOVE FOR OTHERS

Only after that, come the children ... scandal! This hierarchy seems almost unnatural but is actually just the opposite, that is, without our love and our relationship is not possible to generate the children. A couple who puts its spousal relationship to the second place will soon become a barren couple, unbalanced, with the center of gravity shifted away from the family´s very foundation... the couple itself! 
Finally, after God, the wife or the husband and the children, come all the others: parents, friends and needy people of all kinds.

“Oh no,” many will say, “the usual closed-minded and selfish mentality.”

The point is that, from what I understood, for the Lord the amount of people you loved doesn´t matter. What matters is if you are doing His will or not, in your particular situation and calling. However, even if you were a missionary who care for the lepers, if you do not put God in the first place, you risk of losing yourself. Let’s put it this way: what good is to change the tires if there is no fuel in the car? You will not go very far... or throw the pasta, when there is no water in the pot? So what do you want to give? Yourself? That´s not a lot... to Love as God does, you need to put God first, the care of your personal vocation second, and then everyone else. Without this order, we will only focus on *doing* as Martha did in the Gospel, missing the best part and draining our energy as an engine that idles. Maybe we love the good we do, we feel good at doing good deeds and, at the same time, we find tiring taking care of our sick mother because we do not receive anything in return. The secret is that Love is for free! It does not brag and does not boast, does not seek profit and does not expect anything in return, not even "thank you" and not even that little whisper in your heart that tells you how good you were.

Go! Hurry to nourish yourself with the love of God and live a godly engagement/marriage!
