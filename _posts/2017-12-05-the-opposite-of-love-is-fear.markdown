We all know what fear is. There have been times fear took over in my life. Numerous times I’ve been afraid to love someone or something, like a project or a dream. So many times I’ve been afraid to be loved. And again: I’ve been afraid to choose, to decide, to jump in the dark, I’ve been afraid to trust, afraid to be disappointed, afraid to fail, of not being good enough. These are the first four examples that come to my mind:

-   When I started my journey to Assisi with Fr. Giovanni I was afraid I could not be faithful — I had to cover 340 miles once a month in order to meet him. I had no money. I was only 16 years old, and my parents weren’t going to help me since they thought I was crazy (I can’t say they were not onto something there! Luckily they didn’t know Fr. Giovanni yet, otherwise the *theywereontosomething* would have turned to *theywerecompletelyright*!).
-   *When Francesco and I started dating, we were very scared. We thought: "Nice one! Great idea starting a relationship 1000 miles apart! Now, how are we going to see each other?". Francesco was working in Zurich and he didn’t have many days off. I didn’t have the money to go to Rome or Assisi.*
-   When we moved to France we had to leave our friends, we had to leave Rome, Fr. Fabio’s parish, our prayer group, our families. On top of all these goodbyes we had a newborn man cub (our little Chiara!), who was only three months old!!! We were literally wetting ourselves!
-   When our third child arrived, with the potential of unemployment and me still finishing college…

In short, fear was never missing. In my life it’s surely more present than faith...


## God’s perspective

But God has a different perspective on our lives. In fact, it is precisely fear that blocks our relationship with Him, that hinders our leaps toward the True Good. Fr. Fabio used to tell us:

> The opposite of love is not hatred
The opposite of joy is not sadness
The opposite of forgiveness is not resentment
The opposite of faith is not atheism
The opposite of all these things is fear!

**It's because of fear that we do not love**! You are afraid to love a person without reserve because you've been hurt from the previous one, or because deep in your heart you don’t believe you're worthy of being loved by anyone, and so you're always testing and questioning relationships.
**It's because of fear that we're not happy**! [Happiness is a choice]({{site.baseurl}}/happiness-is-a-choice)! I know people who don’t have much (definitely less than what I have) and they are happy. People who suffered a great loss and are happy. Happiness doesn’t come when everything goes right. If it was like that, in northern European countries, where people are wealthy, there wouldn’t be the highest suicide rate in the world. Happiness doesn’t mean not-suffering when we lose someone dear to us. Otherwise we would not see on Enrico’s face, [Chiara Corbella]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary)'s husband, those happy eyes despite the pain. We are afraid to be happy! We are afraid to truly aim high. We are afraid to *bet on that word God’s put into our hearts*! We wet ourselves when it comes to follow Him. [God is too much out of our schemes]({{site.baseurl}}/when-it-seems-there-is-no-way) and I don’t understand Him!

It doesn’t matter what you are called to. What matters is that you are **listening** and you are walking. You may be called to clean the floor in a church, or to speak in front of thousand people in a square - it doesn’t matter. Do not be afraid! Just go!

Fear is what fools us!

I’m writing these things because, once again, this is a time of great fear for me. The Lord calls me to give it all. He is a jealous God (I’ve always known it, but I didn’t imagine He had a Sicilian temper :-) I'm afraid because I know the Lord doesn’t use traditional ways to do His will, He is creative...He is indeed!

Fear could also be referred to as **temptation** because it tempts us, it questions the fact that God has nothing but great things planned for us, He has thoughts of happiness and beauty for us to reach the sky. Hey! We are called to great things!!! Did you know that? You meddle in your affairs, you do not launch yourself in loving that girl and you end up living a pain-free, mutual-defensive relationship. Look, WWF is just for animals! And Green Peace is for whales! Which association are you part of? *Aim at great things*, otherwise it is just a "friendship" or a mediocre relationship. Aim for the best! Make room for your greatest desires! Exaggerate! Tell each other the greatest possible things... it’s pointless to talk about soccer now, we already lost the world cup.

Fear is the temptation to give space to thoughts like: "God shouldn’t have done this to me. He isn’t as so good as they say! If He really loved me as much as you say, He shouldn’t have let me lose my job. If the Lord really loved me, He would have found a man for me; what would it take Him, right?" etc., etc. Faith, instead, reminds us that God has His own creative ways, ways that we now don’t comprehend, but that we’ll come to understand in time. If you were born in the middle of nowhere as opposed to New York City it’s not by chance, be thankful and don’t curse!

Faith is letting yourself be loved, nothing more, nothing less. Fr. Fabio used to end his homilies by saying that having faith is like sunbathing, getting tanned, cherishing the Love of God without any effort. Do you believe it?

I'm scared, but if I look back at my story, at the mercy and the providence that the Lord has used with me every time I had the courage to bet on his word, I can’t do anything but trust Him again. In the end, I managed to pay my monthly visit to Fr. Giovanni, I managed to date Francesco and we survived when we moved to France. How did I do it? Francesco and I always follow this rule taught by St. Ignatius of Loyola, who said: "Do everything as if it was up to you, without forgetting that everything is up to God." In practice this meant that I cleaned the stairs of my old neighbors and did other small jobs here and there to raise money to go to Assisi, and then Providence always surprised me with a friend giving me twenty bucks, a last-minute extra and more. In the end these difficulties that seemed insurmountable became possible to overcome when I believed and I took the first step.

Today I say that I only had one fear in my life, the fear to love and -even more- to let myself be loved. What a fool I have been! When paying attention to fear I missed a lot of opportunities, the seven tons of joy of St Francesco and St Chiara, that fall on your head whenever you enter in the [Porziuncola Church]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary). I just had to believe that God is my Father and to trust Him. From now on I will listen to Fr. Fabio's words: I'm going to sunbathe!

Pray for us!
