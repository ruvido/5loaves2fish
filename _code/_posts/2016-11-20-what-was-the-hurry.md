We were sitting at the table when my dad, struck at the sight of that ring, began a true father-to-daughter talk. Trying to figure out what that ring meant, he started by saying how important family is, how the values​​ he and my mom passed down to me are the foundation for life, and how commendable it was that Francesco and I were taking things seriously, BUT... :

- Alessandra you have to understand that the family is the most important thing. The family is in the first place, BUT you cannot improvise it: first you have to graduate, then you have to find a good job - maybe stable -, then don’t forget to save money in order to buy a nice house; and then you can get married.
- Excuse me dad, but wasn’t the family in the first place?! It seems it is in the last, when you've done everything else. They don’t require you have a degree in order to get married, at most you need to have Confirmation!
- ... (Here I would put a picture of my dad stricken as if it was by lightning).

After a few minutes, necessary to soften the blow, my dad, moved, looked my mom into the eyes and said: "We lost her", meaning that he understood that in a short time I would have left home forever, that is I would have gotten married. But actually the truth was different. The truth was that Francesco and I had already decided to get married. We had already set the date and booked the church. We had already promised faith to one another, followed by a brief blessing by Fr. Massimo. It happened one evening after vespers, on the altar of the Portiuncula after everyone had left the church, with a bouquet of scented red roses and only a few lit candles. We hugged each other and said all the things we wanted to do together as a married couple. We didn’t want to tell anyone because it seemed too precious, and, most of all, we knew it would have generated reactions and scandals. I am saying scandal because we were getting married at 19 years old (I would have become 20 a month after the wedding!), without a degree, without a steady job (especially if the only job involved is a researcher at the university!), without a house, and above all... without being pregnant.

What was the hurry? Why at 20 years old? Why not wait until everything is perfect? Why be so hasty?

The rush is the same that John and Peter had running together to the tomb to see Jesus resurrected (Jh20,4): the haste of explosive joy, of the love that can’t wait, impatient love, the love that asks you all of yourself. Love doesn’t ask you if you plan to graduate on time, or if you have economic stability. I don’t think that a marriage with a permanent job (if only it was easy to find!) is a better marriage. I don’t even think that a marriage between two graduates has more value. But I definitely think a three-way marriage is better because in addition to the spouses there is a third: the Lord. Yes, I think a marriage with God is definitely better and more fun because you are not alone: you have someone who in the difficult times wants to get His hands dirty with you, who supports you when you make a mess, and who is Father.

I always asked God to give me the grace to spend my youth for my vocation. What I felt as urgent was not to waste time with anything that was a frill, but rather to hit the target as soon as possible. For me the target is God and my vocation is the way to serve Him, the place where I can spend myself, where I can meet Him. Why put something before joy, why wait? **Love calls. Love is urgent**.

After nearly eight years of marriage we don’t have a house, we don’t have a permanent job, and I am not graduated (last exams are in July!). But we have more and more certainties: the disorder always comes all at once with the laundry to hang out, the presence of my husband next to me, our daily yes in joy and quarrels, our beautiful children with their chronic bratness, and providence. We lived in four different countries, with four different languages, we moved a thousand times, but we haven’t forgotten our goal, and that hurry hasn’t left us.
