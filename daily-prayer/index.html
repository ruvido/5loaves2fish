<article>

  <p>Nothing special happens, no particular emotion, but everything simply seems to be <strong>in the right place</strong>. With my eyes closed, I address my heart and my spirit to God. Full of confidence in Him, I let myself be emptied so as to give space to the Lord, <strong>the One who is</strong>. It lasts just half an hour: when the alarm goes off again I prepare an orange juice and try to wake up the rest of the crew. And then, like a fixed schedule, the whole day begins: dress up, pack the backpacks, take the children to school and so forth.</p>

<p>Each day can be quite messy and unorganized with three children, a wife, and a house to take care of… but the appointment of the morning prayer remains a stronghold, a secure haven in my day. And in the most turbulent moments, my heart turns there, to His presence. But do not get a wrong impression. I am certainly not a mystic. Nor was I born with this ability. Everything started a little bit more than two years ago, with the wish to carve out some time between me and the Lord beyond just a quick reading of the Gospel or a Mass <strong>on the go</strong>. I felt the need to know Him better and with no schemes, without having to necessarily speak or recite some prayers. <em>I needed to see Him</em>, to put myself in His presence, to contemplate in silence. Like when you stop the car to admire a beautiful view or you admire a painting for a few more seconds. <em>So I felt the need to contemplate Him</em>, the holy might, el todo ponderosa, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, My creator and Lord.</p>

<p>With time this desire became more intense instead of subsiding, making these moments of intimacy with Him impossible to skip. And everything became more meaningful when recently a priest told me:</p>

<p>“The purpose of your life is to love… and in order to love somebody, you must know him; and in order to know somebody, you must spend time with him. To learn to love God, therefore, you have to spend time together in daily prayer and reading of the Gospel.”</p>

<p>Spend time together with God.</p>

<p>So not a distracted thought, a last-minute prayer, a request for some worry, but quality time with Him, el todo poderoso!</p>

<p>If you want to learn to love God <em>you must find this time</em> to spend with him <em>very day</em>. Even if your life was the most stressful, every day in the worse traffic jam, or exhausted from a crazy schedule, or assailed from a crew of little ones that call you <strong>mom</strong> (!) around the clock. <em>You must find the time every day</em>, so that your life bears fruits with Him and in Him.</p>

<p>The point is that it should not be anything complicated and it should not even last some interminable hours: 20 minutes a day can be enough! The important thing, however, is <em>to get into a routine</em>, so that the time in prayer is not an afterthought, the last thing in the day (priority wise), but an integral part of your life, with its physical space and time. Your day should be scheduled with a little bit of monastic order —ora et labora— so that nothing goes lost and you can grab what Jesus calls <em>the best part</em>. There are various ways to get into this routine and I suggest some ways that have been well-tested by the Church over the centuries… you should be able to find something that can work for you :D</p>

<h2 id="1-the-prayer-of-the-hours">1. The prayer of the hours</h2>

<p>If you have ever been a guest at a monastery, you know what we’re talking about. The prayer of the hours consists of reading Psalms and other texts inside of a structured formula (contained in the <strong>breviary</strong>), which marks “the hours” of the day. The most important moments are <strong>Lauds</strong> of the morning, <strong>Vespers</strong> in the evening and <strong>Compline</strong> before going to bed. To begin, try to be faithful to one of these moments, for example before going out in the morning or on the train while going to work. Find a breviary at the bookstore, ask at the parish, or search on the internet.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-daily-rosary">2. The daily Rosary</h2>

<p>This is a prayer loved by many and difficult for just as many others. One thing is certain, the constant and faithful prayer of the Rosary has brought and continues to bring graces upon graces in all of the world! Although praying 50 Hail Marys can seem to be long, in truth it is a prayer that lasts only about 15 minutes. It is our kids’ favorite prayer.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-prayer-of-silence">3. The prayer of silence</h2>

<p>This is instead my favorite prayer. It is a prayer of contemplation in the way of the monks. In order to be faithful, it is important to set up a time, place, and duration for the prayer. It begins with the sign of the cross and an invocation to the Holy Spirit. Then you rest and listen to what He wants to say to our heart. As soon as you realize that the mind is wandering in some thought, take a breath and refocus. For example, I say in my heart: Jesus! Then I finish the prayer time with one Hail Mary.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-reading-of-the-holy-scriptures">4. The reading of the Holy Scriptures</h2>

<p>Like the friar told me, to know Jesus and to love him you have to know his story. The same friar advised me to <em>read a chapter of the New Testament every day</em>, starting with the gospel of Matthew until Revelation. Once arrived at the end, start again! This special knowledge of the scriptures puts you in intimacy with Jesus and his word. For me, reading the Gospel in chronological order has been a revelation, making it possible for me to see links throughout Jesus’ life and those of the apostles that I completely didn’t notice before.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-mass">5. The Mass</h2>

<p>Lastly, the daily Mass. Receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist every day is a holy blessing (if we are in God’s grace, that is, if we have been to confession). It puts us in Communion with the Church and the brothers and it feeds us the same Jesus whose steps we want to follow.</p>

<p>Obviously, these 5 methods are not mutually exclusive - not at all! If it was possible we would have to practice all 5 daily, like they do in monasteries. Just <em>start with one of these</em>. Learn to be obedient and faithful. You will discover God’s faith and peace in this process. Your eyes will become brighter and your soul, filled with the grace of God through the Holy Spirit, will show you the next steps.</p>

<p>Enjoy your prayer!</p>
