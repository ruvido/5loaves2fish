<article>

  <p>However, although I enjoyed dating those girls, I never really considered starting a family or getting married with any of them… I didn’t find any interest in such view of life, because, let’s face it, family life is like a prison! A burdensome life where everything revolves around three things: work, children, and home, the whole package garnished with a car, vacations, and an annoying wife. No adventures, no challenges, no chance to engage with others. Not a fascinating perspective indeed!</p>

<p>Knowing my standpoint, Fr. Max invited me to go to meet a so-called christian <strong>family</strong>. After a series of unsuccessful tries using good manners, the friar eventually convinced me with a kick in the butt! I was thinking: who are these people? I don’t even know them! And most importantly, what the hell do they know about me and my life? Despite these thoughts, I had nothing to lose and so I reluctantly decided to go.</p>

<p>I landed in Fiumicino (Rome) and drove for more than 4 hours to get to Manfredonia, Gargano, Puglia (south of Italy). Eventually, I arrived at <a href="/glossary">Mimmo &amp; Cinzia</a> Armiento’s place. It was August. The first morning we went to the beach, in the evening we ate pizza and on August 2<sup>nd</sup>, the day of forgiveness, we sang prayers. Among all, what I will never forget is a brief conversation I had with Mimmo. Sheltered from the heat under a tree, for the first time in my life I started imagining my future wife. Mimmo was asking me some questions, and he immediately got to the point. He asked me which relationships mattered the most in my life. I had no doubts. My friends from Rome I used to go hiking with: Piero, Claudio… why? He explained to me: “… when you climb a mountain, you entrust your life to your rope partner. He is the one who holds the rope, he is the one will hold you if you fall. Our lives are held together by this mutual absolute blind trust”. In this view of relationships there was adventure, there was the courage of giving yourself at a 100%.</p>

<p>Mimmo look at me and said “You know, my wife Cinzia is exactly this to me: she is my rope partner for life.”</p>

<p>When I heard these words, I was puzzled. I had never heard a similar concept. Especially in relation to someone’s wife, who by definition is a pain in the a**, hysterical, obsessive, generally incompetent, psychologically unstable, always dissatisfied and overweight. Didn’t they write a song about it? “Why? Why on Sundays do you always leave me alone? […] but one day I’ll come with you”; the perfect picture of an annoying woman; her husband’s response must have been “because at least on Sundays I can catch a breath! Even prisoners have free passes, don’t they?”</p>

<p>Given my experiences, Mimmo’s words sounded like an epiphany. I had never thought or imagined that a <strong>wife</strong> could be a rope partner and a reliable good life companion. He invited me to think about what characteristics a hypothetical woman should posses for her to be a good rope partner for my life. And, as I was listing these qualities in my mind, I realized that the women I had dated so far did not embody pretty much any of them. This gave me confidence. So it true, not all women are like that! There is the chance for me too to meet <strong>my</strong> rope partner!</p>

<p>What a joy.</p>

<p>I had been searching the wrong person in the wrong places; but now I had a map. I started thinking of all my friends and acquaintances to see if, by any chance, one of them matched these new parameters. After pondering for a while, my search delivered one - one only - result… it was her. It is her. And I stayed up all night unable to sleep…</p>

<p>The next day I called her and, shyly, we began our climb.</p>
